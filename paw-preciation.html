            <h2>Animals are good for you</h2>
            <p><img alt="cute random animal" src="http://lorempixel.com/200/200/animals" class="floatright"/>&emsp;Why do we have <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/animal-therapy-animal/story?id=24649527">therapy dogs/cats/pigs/miniature horses/rabbits</a>? Just like various activities can help to take our mind off of stress and make us active, so can animals. Interacting with animals, simply put, can make us happier. </p>
            <h3>Get Out There</h3>
            <p>&emsp;Previously we talked about how physical activity can help improve our moods. Telling someone to get active, for their own good, however is often ineffective. Think about all of those new years resolutions never fulfilled; the attempt at healthy diets broken by a tempting snack or a meal out. Studies have shown that having a buddy to motivate us, helps us stay on track with exercising and eating well. This sets up expectations that keep us striving to keep up. However, we may still worry about being judged by our buddy... enter the animal.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Animals are the perfect buddies. They give us motivation to be more active, without having to worry about being judged. Furthermore, especially for dogs, they encourage us to be active, because we know that it is good for them. If we don't take our dogs for walks, then they won't get walked. If we take our dog to the park or on a hike, we know that we will be giving them immeasurable pleasure, which in turn can give us pleasure.</p>
            <p>Animals can also help us to get out there socially. Having a pet can give us a connection to other people with shared interests. For example, taking your dog to the dog park or out for a walk can open you up for more chances to interact with other people. With a dog at your side you are instantly more approachable.</p>
            <h3>Relax</h3>
            <p>&emsp;The simple act of petting an animal can improve our heart rate, decrease cortisol, reduce our blood pressure, and signal a release of oxytocin<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408111/">(supporting study)</a>. Animals can be truly beneficial to our lives on many levels. Taking a moment to just relax with an animal can quite literally improve our health. Need I say more?</p>
            <h3>Think Small</h3>
            <p>&emsp;Animals see everything from a fresh uncluttered perspective, much like babies. In general, we love to experience every first with children, because each new object, sound, person, ...etc is often met with unbridled amazement and joy. These shared experiences help us to remember the little things and appreciate each moment. </p>
            <p>Animals give us this same experience. They can have an unwavering interest in the world around them, which can pull us along. A dog's excitement when a leash is pulled out of a drawer, a puppy's first interaction with snow, a cat's enthrallment with a cardboard box, hearing a guinea pig sing when treats are given, all of these things help us to stay excited about life too.</p>
            <h3>Feel the Love</h3>
            <p><img alt="another cute random animal" src="http://lorempixel.com/100/100/animals" class="floatleft"/>&emsp;Nothing beats the feeling of a loving touch, be it the touch of your mother, hug of a father or a friend, ...etc, but sometimes those special people aren't around. We have to find unconditional love elsewhere, and when we are stressed from work and/or life it can often be hard to find. Animals can supply us with this need as well. Animals won't hold a grudge or judge us(unless mistreated) and we can count on our animal companions to be happy when we are around.</p>

            <p>Yes, some animals make better stress relievers than others, but in general we can count on our animal companions to be there for us, encourage us to be better people, improve our health, and offer us undonditional love.</p>

            <h2>Baboons are Just Like Us</h2>
            <p>When we are stressed, we may find ourselves envying our furry friends. They seem so care free and happy. However they can get stressed too. </p>
            <p>Baboons make an easy parallel to humans. They live in complex social groups like us, constantly having to compete. The least powerful and lowest rung member is harrassed by others and gets the last pick of food.</p>
            <p>We can see our own stresses represented in the emotional dilemnas of these monkeys. Orphaned monkeys in South Africa, where baboons are treated as pests, are often left with deep emotional scars. The baboons have to find ways to cope and alter their perceptions. They often heal through activity, often in the form of play, just as we do. </p>
            <p>Those baby baboons that exert more effort to play or learn social skills are often quickest to show alleviation of stress. We all need ways of coping and we can take notes from baboons. Staying active mentally and physically can help us feel better.</p>
