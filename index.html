            <h2>Learn How to Deal With Stress</h2>
            <p>&emsp; Stress is one of those habits that we all contend with. And yes I say habit, because with careful and consistent thoughts
                and actions we can choose our stress levels. </p>

            <h3>Understanding Stress</h3>
            <p>&emsp; Humans by nature were hunters and gatherers. We lived day to day with simple tasks. All we had to do was gather enough food to survive, hunt if we were capable, find water, find shelter, and survive exposure &amp; predators both large and microscopic. Easy right?</p>
            <p>&emsp; We think our 'way back' ancestors had it easy. Let's get real, they didn't, but they were competing against nature with natural insticts and rudimentary skills, today's homo sapien has to compete against themselves. We have to compete against fears and insecurities resulting from living in a complex society. Our ancestors fought to physically survive and it seems like more and more the modern homo sapien is fighting a battle for mental survival.</p>
            <p>&emsp; Many of us feel the need to compare ourselves to others and strive for personal perfection. With the onslaught of Social Media, it is now easier than ever to constantly hold ourselves up to an unhealthy standard. When we look at all of the achievements and enjoyments of others, in their often edited glory, we wonder what we are doing wrong.</p>
            <h3>Dealing with Stress</h3>
            <p>&emsp; Dealing with stress takes a healthy dose of perspective. We need to be able to realize that often issues that seem to loom large, can be diminutive in the bigger picture of life. Trying to make ourselves change perspective through force of mind alone is difficult and often counter productive. By focusing on minimizing our issues, we may still spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about them. This is when we need to turn outward from our minds and engage in activities.</p>
            <p>&emsp; Get out of your own head and find a class that you would like to take. Take up a new hobby. Learn an instrument. Read a book. Join a club/group. Watch a movie. Take up exercise. Not only by being more active and focusing your thoughts and energies can you feel better, but you will also be accomplashing small goals which can add to your self esteem. So get out there and get moving, you will feel better. </p>

            <h2>Turn to Meditation</h2>
            <p>People's stress is often a manifestation of their negative thoughts, which spiral them into a darker perspective on life. Take a little bit of time out of your day to relax your mind and focus your thoughts onto something positive. Meditation is a means of training your mind to calm itself and have more control.</p>
